# MRP_Dataset
This dataset contains the material removal profiles (MRPs) under different process parameters collected from robotic belt grinding system. 
A detailed description can be found in the paper.

$X = [r, v_s, v_w, F_n, dis_i, 1]^T$

$t = \text{MRP}_i$

$i$ is the index which corresponds to the header in the table.
